## Release

### 0.3.2 ALPHA
Everyone's favourite feature is here: copy-and-paste!

New features:

- component copy-and-paste - copy components within and even across different diagrams (Subdiagram component is currently not supported in copy-and-paste. You must create a new subdiagram yourself then copy other components into it).
- Drag-and-drop component: new components can be added by draging the component from the sidebar and drop onto the diagram.
